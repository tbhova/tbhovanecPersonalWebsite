# Amazon Software Development Engineer Internship Summer 2016


## Position Description

**Department:** Amazon Classification and Catalog Selection Systems  
**Team:** Model Studio Classification Platform  
**Title:** Software Development Engineer Intern  
**Project:** Catalog Item Classification Debug Tool  

## Project

### Project Description

My team was responsible for the development and maintenance of an internal classification platform.
The tool provided a means to write classification rules that classify products in the amazon.com catalog as either a positive or negative match agains the classifcation rule.

My project was to develop a new tool as addition to the classification platform. The goal of this tool is to help understand why a product was or was not caught with a given classification rule.

My tools initial purpose is to help developers resolve user trouble tickets and learn about a rule. Eventually, the tool could be used by users also to understand the rules they write and to write better rules.

Initially I was given the open ended requirements to create a debug tool that explains classifications. No one really knew what it should do or what it should look like. The project was my responsibility from this requirements gathering stage all the way through production deployment of the finished product.
